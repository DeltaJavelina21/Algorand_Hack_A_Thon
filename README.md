# Algorand_Hack_A_Thon
16 bit Classic Side Scroller

My vision - a 16 bit classical side scroll-er like Mega Man, Mario or Sonic 
which rewards valued NFTs as rewards for completions and 
as upgrades to earn higher valued NFTs.  

I am a novice to video game building and block chain development, 
but Algorand appears to be an excellent place to plant an iconic seed.  

Any guidance and addition to the team is welcomed.
